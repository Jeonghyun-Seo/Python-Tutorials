    "This tutorial uses a new RNG algorithm that was added to numpy in a relatively recent version. If the environemnt you are running this on does not have a new enough numpy distirbution, you will get the error `TypeError: module 'numpy.random' has no attribute 'default_rng'` in the first cell below. If you get such an error, try running the cell below, which will upgrade to the newest version of numpy, and then restart the kernel (under the \"Kernel\" menu option above). "
