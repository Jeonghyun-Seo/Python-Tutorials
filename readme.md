# Python Bootcamp

These are introductory materials that are designed for physics students with little to no prior programming experience. These notebooks are far from comprehensive, but they are designed to ease new learner's into the general flow of things. We prioritize the basics in order to get students to the point where they can branch out and seek additional material elsewhere.

We plan to add additional material at the intermediate level that is geared towards more practical physics applications

# Getting started

You can click this link (TODO) to launch into the datahub where the notebooks can be read and run interactively. Alternatively, if you don't have a Berkeley login, you can launch using the binder button above.
