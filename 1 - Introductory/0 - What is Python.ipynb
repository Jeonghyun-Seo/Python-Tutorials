By the end of this set of notebooks hopefully it won't be intimidating to read through notebooks to understand what they're doing, and you will be equipped to write some basic programs!\n",

    "## What is Python\n",
    "Python is a programming language, enabling us to tell the computer how to work for us. Learning to program can seem daunting at first because of the funny <span class=\"underline\">syntax</span>, but really we are just learning <span class=\"underline\">how to precisely</span> tell the computer what to do, much like you might have learned how to talk to a younger sibling when you need them to do something.\n",

    "If you are reading this, chances are you are in a Jupyter notebook environment. Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing bits of code with explanations. They have a mix of text and code intermingled. You can <span class=\"underline\">execute</span> code by either hitting 'shift + enter' or hitting the play button at the top. Code execution just means you are done writing your instructions for the computer and want the computer to carry them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter notebook, the code gets executed one block at a time. These are called cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the cell below for your first program! You can either press `Shift + Enter` or there is a button in the toolbar at the top that says `Run`."
