    "## Lists vs arrays\n",
    "Python lists are dynamic and flexible. You can change the legth of a list by adding or removing entries, and you can add entries of any type. NumPy arrays, on the other hand, are more rigid: their length is immutable and all the entries must have the same type, given by the data type of the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computations with NumPy arrays are faster than those with lists, because they can take advantage of these additional constraints to implement these computations more efficiently. Suppose we wanted to create a list-like object that contains $n^3$ for $n$ upto some large $N$. The following cells do that in various ways. Run them and see which is the fastest. (The `%%timeit` command is an _IPython magic_ that times the execution of a cell several times and prints the statistics. The `%timeit` magic times the execution of a single line. Use the similar `time` magic to time the execution only once.)"

    "As we discussed earlier, we should avoid using lists where we can easily replace it with NumPy arrays. The above is one example: we can replace the list of numpy arrays `vectors` with a single 2-dimensional numpy array. Like a 1d (flat) numpy array is a vector, a 2d numpy array is a matrix, and higher dimensional arrays are like tensors. A multi-dimensional numpy array is simply a 1d array with a shape, in that the elements are ultimately stored sequentially in memory. The shape tells numpy how to access certain elements, so we can pretend to have higher-dimensional data structures. Think of how a $M\\times N$ matrix might carry the same information as a $MN$-dimensional vector. \n",

The length of this tuple is the \"rank\" of the \"tensor\", which is stored in the `ndim` attribute. Since ultimately each array is stored flat, this only changes the way we address the elements. This means changing the shape of an array is quick and easy, using the `reshape` method ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.reshape.html)), passing in a tuple whose product is the same as the current shape (where do you think this requirement comes from?). If you pass in `-1` as the size of (at most) one axis, it will deduce the size automatically. You can use the `flatten` method ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flatten.html)) to make any array one-dimensional."

The most common approaches are to either embed it into 3d space, $z=f(x,y)$ and plot the resulting surface in 3d, or to use colours to indicate the function value at various $(x,y)$ points, effectively creating an image. We shall walk you through one such example, not only to show you how to do this, but also to teach you about _broadcasting._\n",

    "Broadcasting is the name given to numpy's automatic reshaping of arrays when required. To do computations, arrays must have exactly the same shape, i.e. the size must be the same in each axis. However, sometimes two arrays can have compatible shapes. This happens if one of the size along matching axes (starting from the innermost axes) is 1, in which case that size is scaled up by repeating the array along the axis (e.g. if array `a` has shape `(1,5,1,9)` and array `b` has shape `(10,1,3,9)`, `a+b` will return an array of shape `(10,5,3,9)`). It can also happen when one array has a subshape of another array (e.g. if array `a` has shape `(2,3,4,5)` and array `b` has shape `(4,5)`, `b` will be interpreted as having shape `(1,1,4,5)`).
