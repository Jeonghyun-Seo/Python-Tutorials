    "## Primitives vs objects\n",
    "An _object_ is an entity that can have attributes and methods. A _primitive_ on the other hand, is simply a value. Consider the difference between a list and an integer. A list has many associated pieces of data, including the values of the list, and actions that can be done to this specific list, like adding and removing values. It is convenient to store all these data and actions in a single reference to the list, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associated data values are called _attributes_ and associated functions are called _methods,_ and are accessed using a dot after the reference to the object itself, as shown below."

    "## Creating your own classes\n",
    "You can define your own data structures by defining a `class` similarly to how you define a function. The most important method is `__init__(self, *args)`: it defines a _constructor,_ which is a function that creates objects that are instances of this class. You can define attributes, using the special `self` reference to the instantiated object to access/modify attributes and methods. The `__repr__` method determines how the object is printed, or in general, how it is represented by a string. \n",

    "The following object allows us to store all rational numbers exactly (since arbitrarily large integers can be stored exactly in Python).
